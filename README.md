# current-app-discord-rich-presence
a simple piece of code to show which app im using on discord

you will need to make an application from the developer portal and insert the client id where needed

you will also need to upload the images to the rich presence part thingy

ok bye

(you can rename the bot.py to bot.pyw if you want to run it without the python terminal)
